On top of the downturned cards, an upturned card is dealt on the left-most downturned pile, and downturned cards on the rest until all piles have an upturned card. The piles should look like the figure to the right.\r\n\r\nThe four foundations (light rectangles in the upper right of the figure) are built up by suit from Ace (low in this game) to King, and the tableau piles can be built down by alternate colors, and partial or complete piles can be moved if they are built down by alternate colors also. Any empty piles can be filled with a King or a pile of cards with a King. The aim of the game is to build up a stack of cards starting with 2 and ending with King, all of the same suit. Once this is accomplished, the goal is to move this to a foundation, where the player has previously placed the Ace of that suit. Once the player has done this, they will have \"finished\" that suit, the goal being, of course, to finish all suits, at which time the player would have won. There are different ways of dealing the remainder of the deck:\r\n\r\nTurning three cards at once to the waste, either allowing three passes through the deck or placing no limit on passes through the deck.\r\nTurning three cards at once, reversing the order of each group of three as the cards are dealt.\r\nTurning only one card at a time, but only passing through the deck once.\r\nTurning only one card at a time, but placing no limit on passes through the deck.\r\nTurning three cards at once to the waste with no limit on passes through the deck, but allowing the player to switch once to a single pass through the deck one card at a time; after that single pass, however, the player cannot go back to turning three cards at a time and can turn over no more cards from the waste.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9NZS1WR0N380","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Toy Blast Mania","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.59555.14470234918747483.44a8e14c-4fb8-4a13-a423-5094a6416fcc.64948d9d-3aae-4315-9408-90ce0b3af9a6","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#FFFFFF","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.7278.14470234918747483.5bdf7aae-8f16-4712-963e-aa7bc0ae4236.8c0c5c46-44f8-480e-9c52-8b229fd6b92e","Height":300,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"#FFFFFF","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.59555.14470234918747483.44a8e14c-4fb8-4a13-a423-5094a6416fcc.64948d9d-3aae-4315-9408-90ce0b3af9a6","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#FFFFFF","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["5895BlastCrushGames.ToyBlastMania_f1613047p3868"],"ContentIds":["b4461e86-5769-b42c-c6e3-67ff10678faf"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"THE ULTIMATE MATCHING PUZZLE GAME WITH UNIQUE MAGIC POWERS AND BOOSTS!\r\n\r\n♥ Join the fun world of Amy and help collect her precious toys! ♥ \r\n\r\nMatch two or more blocks of the same color to clear the level and collect the toys from where they stuck.

Design custom spaceships, manage your crew members and wield the elemental powers of your army of worker drones to defeat the ancient guardians that litter the landscape. Engage in action-packed battles and use your strategy (and a bit of luck) to conquer the richest resource deposits throughout the dynamic world. Or, team up with friends to test your skills in competitive gameplay modes as part of this ever-growing open world full of danger and untold riches.\r\n\r\nBUILD CUSTOM SPACESHIPS\r\nLet your imagination run wild with nearly limitless combinations of ship parts, paints and other customizations to create your own unique spacecraft for strategy, looks and total domination.\r\n\r\nBATTLE FOR RESOURCES\r\nCommand your arsenal of drones in epic space battles against ancient guardians for valuable resources. Compete with other pilots for the most valuable deposits of crystals, gems, elemental cores and scrap spacecraft parts, or team up with them to take on the most fearsome of opponents.\r\n\r\nGROW YOUR FLEET\r\nOne mining spaceship is great, but in Exocraft you can design and build an entire fleet. Manage each starship’s crew members, control your elemental drones and expand your space mining empire to become the ultimate space tycoon.\r\n\r\nSURVIVE THE ALIEN LANDSCAPE\r\nThis alien world is an unforgiving desert wasteland, and not everyone makes it out alive. Hone your skills and strategy as you build up your defenses to survive and prosper as the ultimate space mining fleet.\r\n\r\nTEAM UP WITH FRIENDS\r\nIt’s dangerous to go alone into the vast desert. Dangers are at every turn, so team up with friends to take on the most dangerous and valuable of guarded mines. Or, enter your best spaceships in the competitive Team Race mode where you and others compete for the most resources in an exciting race against time.\r\n\r\nJOIN A SQUAD\r\nBuild an alliance of the best pilots to challenge yourself to new heights as part of monthly tournaments and rankings.

optimized for preschool and elementary school children.\r\nI have created this app for my own child and have been constantly upgrading it.\r\nThe app has three modes “Triplets” game, “Training” and “Colouring”.\r\n \r\nThe “Triplets” game helps understand and memorize addition and subtraction within ten. The child is given three digits and two operators and has to compose the case him/herself.\r\nWhat’s so special about it? The child visually memorizes the case itself and can see what will happen if he changes the digits. Now there is no need to scissor out paper digits. The program itself indicates whether or not your child has composed the case right.\r\n \r\n“Training” is an easy-to-handle tool for effective instruction of your child. Forget about countless slips of paper with cases written on them! Everything is right here: addition, subtraction, multiplication and division. After solving the problem the results are saved and can be seen on the stats page, the graph represents the results and the number of errors. This helps to track the dynamics of learning.\r\n \r\nOnce your child has learnt to solve the cases, you won’t have to study with him. After the solving you will always be able to see the way he or she has solved it.\r\n \r\nToday there is no app with similar functionality.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9WZDNCRDG64B","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Running Fred","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.5540.9007199266300333.3c475ea0-5028-4936-a343-91ff4d8e500e.97bdf879-1665-49b7-89da-38bc53ef6840","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#9231bf","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.62866.9007199266300333.62a395ca-2ef5-4c6b-a249-16694c438efe.f43c392a-19b6-4860-b353-2c8fd5bcbfdc","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#9231bf","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free⁺","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["Dedalord.5547658D752BA_s9r3r0hn54nba"],"ContentIds":["7bc64939-74f4-9c15-a31a-ff35ff6a7716","1e6dcda3-f8b6-02a1-162d-c713eb23f1c6"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":" ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,Mobile","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Fred is back with a new host of painful antics, awesome acrobatic/desperate moves, special items and uber-cool locations.\r\n\r\nTake control of our hapless hero as he pursues his quest to remain among the living!

This is the most complete and realistic RC simulator available!\r\n\r\nNote: we are constantly adding more, you will see them listed when you install the program!\r\n\r\nThe program includes different flying fields, boat and car race tracks.\r\n\r\nWe also includes 3 interactive object sets that can be loaded on any flying field. The interactive objects can be used for learning landing and precise model control. \r\n\r\nIn addition to the fixed point camera that represents the RC pilot point of view, we have included follow up camera that allows for walking behind the model. That is useful when you just start, so the model never gets away. \r\n\r\nPlease try our full featured professional RC flight simulator ClearView for PC here: http://rcflightsim.com - see the video of ClearView bellow.\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes: \r\n1. This is not a game. You are controlling flying rc models that reacts like real flying models. It takes some time to learn, and again, do not expect \"arcade\" style controls. \r\n2. The onscreen control sticks are just indicators! They are made small so they do not obscure the screen. \r\n\r\n*** You do not need to keep your fingers on them *** \r\n\r\nSliding your finger any where on the right screen half affects the right control stick , the same for the left screen part - sliding finger there moves the left control stick. \r\n\r\nWe suggest to select beginner settings at first few days before you can comfortably progress further.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9WZDNCRDL0MZ","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Real Fighter Air Simulator","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.microsoft.com/image/apps.28325.9007199266411008.aedbc0df-903b-4045-86df-2a1b7a1d3921.3f178e7a-7da3-40b4-999a-d133d726a3e2","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.20200.9007199266411008.179d93e6-eaa0-4309-bba4-e8a5c1caffd6.3f684408-05b1-4137-8a0d-0e7f5f121959","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["AbsoLogixTechnologiesLimi.RealFighterAirSimulator_bqy72ee6esnst"],"ContentIds":["2c508aa0-05b4-ee37-5b5a-26eeab9de2f8","5029f728-6e55-3a3a-077b-1ec25ab3853b"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":" ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,Mobile","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Did you ever dreamed that you are fighter aircraft pilot... flying plane over the enemy base... targeting the buildings, enemy camps and vehicles from air? \r\nHere is a game for you \"Real fighter Air simulator\" it will let you fly fighter plane and shoot down ground enemy base camps.This 3D fighter plane simulator is your chance to put yourself in the pilot’s cockpit of a war machine in air. \r\nThis Real fighter Air Simulator is based on realistic flight simulator where you have to pilot a war machine thrusting in air towards the enemy base camps...\r\n\r\nTo be the most successful war machine pilot in the sky you need to follow the directions from maps and flight control closely.

The aim of the game is to get all of the cards in order (King to Ace). To win, you must remove all the cards from the table by building columns organized in descending order, from king to ace. At intermediate (2-suits) and advanced (4-suites) levels, the cards must also match suit. When you succeed in building a sequentially-ordered column, it flies off the table. If you run out of moves, click the pile at the bottom of the table to deal a new row of cards. \r\n\r\nIn our version we largely tried to recreate a full experience of that version in a tiny download package, along with multiple suite versions of the game, hints and undo (top right corner of the title bar). But there are also some minor twists to make it easier to play on a small factor mobile devices. In particular you don't have to select a card to move - drag and drop entire column - only appropriate cards will move, the rest will snap back. The scoring is also changed - only number of moves counted - the lower the score - the better.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9WZDNCRDM822","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Puzzle Craft","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.7411.9007199266447233.48518232-d1f0-4089-9d76-ec855f66bc21.9f05e1eb-142f-47fa-82a4-03e7cb24a5f0","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#FFFFFF","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.2681.9007199266447233.cc07b5e6-8c81-42c2-b209-8a1d69d558b8.fe949171-9e5f-416c-98b3-9499fd4eeca3","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#FFFFFF","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free⁺","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["0BCF39DC.PuzzleCraft_7r58kgx22y7jj"],"ContentIds":["3c3cc9e7-37b5-92d3-bc07-47c0c5bf5016"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Some villagers have started a new settlement and they've put you in charge.

Board pieces move based on dice throws.\r\n\r\nThis is a game of skill. A single game can be decided by luck, but the more one plays, the more the skill is important. After ~30 games the true skill emerges. Even a beginner can beat an expert through luck of draw in a single game, but after several games the skill prevails.\r\n\r\nThis version of Backgammon uses an advanced neural network in the highest levels, and will challenge advanced players. It also offers a fun experience for beginners, with lower difficulty levels and showing possible moves.\r\n\r\nThe scoring is based on the official Backgammon ELO system, with each game increasing or reducing rating points every game or match.\r\n\r\nFEATURES:\r\n=========\r\n* Worldwide online high scores\r\n* Play a Trial Game, or a Scored Game that counts towards your score\r\n* High res graphic board\r\n* Dice statistics history\r\n* Real time probability calculation\r\n* Achievements\r\n* Tutorials\r\n* 4 difficulty levels: easy to hard\r\n* 1 or 2 player mode\r\n* Many options:\r\n    -

How? You blow at them with more bubbles, and when three or more of the same color come together, they all explode. Just tap at where you want the next bubble to go.\r\nThe more bubbles blow up at one tap, the increasingly more points you gain (six ones at one tap is better tan two three-bubble taps). Besides, those bubbles that fell apart from the rest will explode too. It is well worth trying to arrange such avalanches, as they will give you ten times more points than ordinary bursts.\r\nAnother important rule to know is that the borders are like mirrors. If you shoot a bubble towards an exposed border, it will not stick to the border but will bounce right back like a stream of light against a mirror.

One of the Microsoft developers noticed this version and implemented a version for Windows. It was first included with Win32s as an application that enabled the testing of the 32-bit thunking layer (does anyone remember what that was?). FreeCell remained relatively obscure until it was released as part of Windows 95. \r\nSince then the game has been ported to numerous platforms. So why should you give our version a try? We largely tried to recreate a full experience of the game in a tiny download package, including power moves, hints and undo (top right corner of the title bar). But there are also some minor twists to make it easier to play on a small factor mobile devices. In particular you don't have to select a card to move - drag and drop entire column - only appropriate cards will move, the rest will snap back. The cards will be moved to foundation automatically when possible. The scoring is also changed - only number of moves counted - the lower the score - the better. \r\n\r\nOnly the top (exposed) card of each tableau pile is available for play. It may be moved to a foundation pile, a free cell, or to another tableau pile. Within the tableau, cards are built down in sequence and alternating in color. Any card may be moved into an empty space. Blocks of cards may not be moved, unless the requisite number of free cells and/or tableau spaces are available to allow each individual card to be moved. To move part of partial pile, drag whole pile - the game will self adjust. If you fill all four foundation piles, you win. \r\nIf you don't see any more moves try hints, undo (top right corner) to back track, or menu to start new game.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9WZDNCRFJCDL","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Doodle Jewels Lite","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.20846.9007199266251569.31404e38-39a5-4af9-b454-faef419be8a0.43cec617-1224-41ef-8dc6-a6f0e462915c","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#FFFFFF","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.29091.9007199266251569.098b7231-5b01-467c-bac9-2b30e040dde8.d681e7da-6e3b-4785-82c1-14542a71f638","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#FFFFFF","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["SoftwareRiverSolutionsInc.DoodleJewelsLite_gwmyqany4g2yy"],"ContentIds":["36782e6f-1b8a-898e-6bf4-956e2654c482"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"The best jewel swap (gem swap) game around!
