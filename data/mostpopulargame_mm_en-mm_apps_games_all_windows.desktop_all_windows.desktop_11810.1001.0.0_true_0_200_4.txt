Recall your childhood!\r\n\r\nLudo game that traces its lineage to 6th century India. Ludo is derived from game Pachisi. Ludo is also very similar to Spanish board game.\r\n\r\nLudo game has stayed popular throughout the ages, varying only a little in its game structure. This persevering game is now available for you to play in an all new modernized format, i.e. as a video game application.\r\n\r\nThe game is played between 2 to 4 players and you have the option of playing the game against the computer, against your friends, or even against people from around the world. The objective of the game is pretty straightforward; each player gets 4 tokens, these tokens must make a full turn of the board and then make it to the finish line.\r\n\r\nWhoever gets all four tokens to the end first is the winner. However, each move can only be made based on the number decided by casting a six-sided die, and each token can only move out of their home by casting a six. Additionally, the competition factor of the games is upped by the fact that while moving if another player’s token lands on the same square as your token, then your token will automatically be sent back home and you’ll need to roll a six again.\r\n\r\nLudo King is a game that was played by kings and now it can be enjoyed by you and your family and friends. While the game play might seem simple at first, the game is immensely enjoyable and challenging. You’ll be playing this one for hours and its fun for the whole family. Try to beat your opponents and compete for the highest scores on the leaderboards.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel,

In order to do that your child has to learn English letters and combine them into words, which represent the names of the captured animals. \r\n\r\nIt’s not a big secret that many kids can face difficulties learning to read in English, because English letters in real words have different pronunciation rules in comparison with their sounds in the English alphabet. \r\n\r\n“Learn to Read & Save the Animals” educational game offers efficient Phonics techniques in order to learn how to read in English. During the process of playing the educational game the children will hear the sound of each English letter in exactly the same way as it’s pronounced in the shown word. \r\n\r\nIt allows your child to understand the rules of English word reading on the subconscious level.

His freedom will now be at risk, because a hunter has landed on the island to add this rare animal to his private zoo.\r\nThis tiny bird with the name fector will have to keep his eyes wide open in order to escape from his enemies hands.\r\n\r\nYour task will be to try and help our fluffy friend to keep his life as it is and rescue him, from what could become a real dungeon.\r\nAppeal to all your abilities to get him out of trouble, dodge big waterfalls, rocks and do not get cached from the hunter’s net. Land on the beach to kick the crabs back in the water and then take off quickly.  \r\nRemember to fly always within the confines of the island delimited by the beach, as the ocean is hiding a big danger.  In fact the island is permanently being controlled by a hungry shark that is always waiting for a new tasty pray.\r\n\r\n\r\nFeatures:\t\r\n\r\n- Easy touch and tilt control\r\n- Original 3D-run function combines jumping, turning and change of altitude (nosedive).\r\n- Colorful graphics and smooth animations\r\n- One of the coolest animal apps to play with!\r\n- The never-ending mega game\r\n- 3 different game modes: Run (normal), slow (easy), fast (hard)\r\n- Special abilities:\r\n- Lightning: Makes you fly much faster (at a nearly uncontrollable speed)\r\n- Snail: Resets your speed to normal (slows you down)\r\n- Green flare: Makes you invincible for 10 seconds (The only thing you have to remember is to turn at every corner)\r\n\r\nAdvise: Be a good vactor and catch the Snails on the ground during your rush to slow down the speed and increase the possibility of getting farther.\r\n\r\nWarning: Avoid the lightning power up that are suspended in the air, as it will give you a super turbo boost that makes you incredibly fast, but you will probably quickly lose control of the flappy bird. The only way to stop the high speed is to take a snail.\r\n\r\n3, 2, 1 go! Start your cartoon running adventure!\r\n\r\nThis is a fun and free application.

The killer whale is in a ferocious mood. The thrill of controlling a fierce angry whale is unmatchable. Angry whale simulator 2016 is a super animal simulator and gives you a chance to watch and simulate a killer whale attack in deep sea and on the beach. So dive into the ocean and be a part of this adventure as an Angry Whale as this orca knows no stopping.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnimal simulators give you the opportunity to observe the wildlife and sea animal life from a close perspective. Angry Whale Simulator 2016 will give you that chance of controlling a whale that attacks and eat underwater animals and humans alike. The Orca whale experience is better than the shark jaws or piranha. Whales are huge animals that can stay both in deep and shallow waters and once they come close to surface, can run havoc on the beach and the boats. So feed the whale by attacking the targets and make sure you stay out of the range of hunters.\r\n\r\n\r\nAngry whale needs food to survive and you have multiple missions that include attacking people on the beach and animals in the sea. The killer whale is out on the hunt. Use the on screen navigation controls to swim in water and reach the target. Happy hunting\r\n\r\nWe hope you enjoy the Angry Whale Simulator 2016 game.

It is fundamentally different from most solitaire games in that very few hands are unsolvable. Although software implementations vary, most versions label the hands with a number (derived from the random number seed used to generate the hand).\r\n\r\nA version of FreeCell was created by Microsoft for release with the Windows operating system.\r\n\r\nFreeCell solitaire is one kinds of funny solitaire card game, but it's not like other solitaires. You need no luck to win, only skill is required. All cards are opened from the start and the deal has the solution, you can win, think and move wisely. \r\n\r\nKey Features: \r\n- deals with different difficulty \r\n- every completed deal has score \r\n- customizable background and card \r\n- magnetic card movement \r\n- supermove: multiple card dragging \r\n- drag or tap to move \r\n- undo option \r\n- optimized battery usage for very long gameplay \r\n\r\nRules\r\nConstruction and layout\r\nOne standard 52-card deck is used.\r\nThere are four open cells and four open foundations. Some alternate rules use between one to ten cells.\r\nCards are dealt into eight cascades, four of which comprise seven cards and four of which comprise six. Some alternate rules will use between four to ten cascades.\r\n\r\nBuilding during play\r\nThe top card of each cascade begins a tableau.\r\nTableaux must be built down by alternating colors.\r\nFoundations are built up by suit.\r\n\r\nMoves\r\nAny cell card or top card of any cascade may be moved to build on a tableau, or moved to an empty cell, an empty cascade, or its foundation.\r\nComplete or partial tableaus may be moved to build on existing tableaus, or moved to empty cascades, by recursively placing and removing cards through intermediate locations. Computer implementations often show this motion, but players using physical decks typically move the tableau at once.\r\n\r\nVictory\r\nThe game is won after all cards are moved to their foundation piles.\r\nVarious computer versions of Freecell occasionally deal unsolvable games.\r\n\r\n\r\nHistory\r\nOne of the oldest ancestors of FreeCell is Eight Off. In the June 1968 edition of Scientific American, Martin Gardner described in his \"Mathematical Games\" column a game by C. L. Baker that is similar to FreeCell, except that cards on the tableau are built by suit rather than by alternate colors. Gardner wrote, \"The game was taught to Baker by his father, who in turn learned it from an Englishman during the 1920s.\" This variant is now called Baker's Game. FreeCell's origins may date back even further to 1945 and a Scandinavian game called Napoleon in St. Helena (not the game Napoleon at St. Helena, also known as Forty Thieves).\r\n\r\nPaul Alfille changed Baker's Game by making cards build according to alternate colors, thus creating FreeCell. He implemented the first computerised version of it in the TUTOR programming language for the PLATO educational computer system in 1978. Alfille was able to display easily recognizable graphical images of playing cards on the 512 * 512 monochrome display on the PLATO systems.\r\n\r\nThis original FreeCell environment allowed games with 4–10 columns and 1–10 cells in addition to the standard 8 * 4 game. For each variant, the program stored a ranked list of the players with the longest winning streaks. There was also a tournament system that allowed people to compete to win difficult hand-picked deals. Paul Alfille describes this early FreeCell environment in more detail in an interview from 2000.\r\n\r\n\r\nSolver complexity\r\nThe FreeCell game has a constant number of cards. This implies that in constant time, a person or computer could list all of the possible moves from a given start configuration and discover a winning set of moves or, assuming the game cannot be solved, the lack thereof. To perform an interesting complexity analysis one must construct a generalized version of the FreeCell game with 4 * n cards. This generalized version of the game is NP-complete; it is unlikely that any algorithm more efficient than a brute-force search exists that can find solutions for arbitrary generalized FreeCell configurations.\r\n\r\nThere are 52! (i.e., 52 factorial), or approximately 8*1067, distinct deals. However, some games are effectively identical to others because suits assigned to cards are arbitrary or columns can be swapped.
